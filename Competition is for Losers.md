# 1) CAPTURING VALUE
- A business creates X$ of value and captures Y% of X. X and Y are independent variables. Example: Airlines make much more money but profit margin is nearly zero. Whereas Google is much more valuable.
- There are two kinds of businesses in this world, businesses that are super competitive and those that are monopolies.
## Perfect Competition
- Pros: easy to model, efficient in a static world, politically salable.
- Cons: psychologically unhealthy, irrelevant in the dynamic world, preempts question of value.
## Monopoly
- Pros: incentive to innovative, stable and long term planning, deeper project planning, symptomatic of creation.
- Cons: lower output and higher prices, price discrimination, stifle innovation, tying.
# 2) LIES THAT PEOPLE TELL
- If there was a spectrum from perfect competition to monopolies, people who have monopolies pretend not to (you don't want to get regulated by the government) and will pretend that they are in perfect competition.
- On the other side of the spectrum, if you are in a business that will never make money, you will be tempted to lie that goes like you are doing something unique that is somehow less competitive than it looks.
- Non-monopolies: "we're in a narrow market", if terms of set theory, they describe their business as an intersection of various markets. For monopolies, it is the opposite.
- Google as a search engine is a monopoly but when it describes itself as an advertising company, the whole viewpoint changes, you're competiting with a much bigger market. If google describes itself as a tech company, it competes with a huge market.
# 3) HOW TO BUILD A MONOPOLY?
- Start with a very small market and monopolise, it is easier to capture a small market than a large one. Or start big and shrink.
# 4) LAST MOVER ADVANTAGE
- Characteristics of monopoly: proprietery technology, network effects, economics of scale and branding.
- Have a tech that's an order of magnitude better than the next best thing.
- Network is something very hard to get started.
- Be the last company in the category. Google was the last search engine.
- Durability > Growth rates.
- Breakthroughs in tech are important and you need to explain why your's will be the last breakthrough in the years to come. You also need to improve at a quick enough pace that no one can ever catch up with.
