# HOW TO START A STARTUP?
- There are four areas where we need to excel at: Idea, Product, Team and Execution.
## WHY?
- Never start just for the sake of doing so.
- You should feel compelled by a problem and should be ceratain that only creating a company can solve it. Passion first, startup second.
# 1) IDEA
- Start with one, not a pivot.
- Think about size and growth of the market, growth statergy for the company, defensibility statergy and so on.
- Wait to start a startup and wait until you come up with an idea you feel compelled to explore. Also a way to choose between multiple ideas. If you have several ideas that all seem pretty good, work on the one that you think about most often and don't think about work.
- The company to should feel like an important mission. Good startups usually take ten years.
- Its easier to start a hard startup than an easy one. This is a counter-intuivitive. Derivative companies that copy an existing idea with very few insights, don't compel their teams to work hard enough to be successful.
- Best ideas look terrible at the beginning. Startup is somewhere between "It is a good idea" and "It seems like a bad idea". If others say its a bad idea, be happy about that. That means no competition. "If a idea doesn't sound absurd at the beginning, there is no hope to it. 
- You can't get monopoly in a big market right away. Find a small market to get a monopoly and quickly expand.
- You want an idea about which you can say, "I know why it seems like a bad idea, but here is specifically why it is a great one". Sound crazy but also right.
- You need to research about the market. You need a market that is big in ten years. Investors make a mistake here, they care about the growth of the startup and not the market.
- Go after a company which is small but rapidly growing market than a big company in a small one.
- Most people think first of what they want to express or make, then find the audience for their idea. You do the exace opposite, thinking of the public first. You need to keep focus on their chaning trends, on their chaning needs. Beginning with their demand, you create the appropriate supply. 
## WHY NOW? 
- Why coudn't it have been done two years ago. Why is this the perfect time for this particular idea and to start this particular company. Why two years in the future will be two late?
- In general its best to build something that you need, you will understand it much better.
- If it takes more than a sentance to tell what your startup idea is about, then it is complicated.
## While you are a student:- 
- Think about new ideas.
- Meet potential co-founders.

# 2) PRODUCT
- Great idea -> Great product -> Great company
- Build something that users love.
- Talk to users.
- Build something that small no. of small users love than large no. of users like. It will be easier to expand.
- Great but simple products win.
- Get people manually, the goal is to get a small group of them to love you.
- Show it to users -> User feedback: What do they like? What do they pay for? What would make them recommend it? -> Product decision. This feedback loop should be as tight as possible. 
- Metrics (focus on growth):- Total registrations, active users, activity levels, cohort retention, revenue, net promotor score etc.
## Why start a startup?
- It is actually stressful. Responsibility: Your team bet the best years of their life on you, you are always on call, fundraising, unwanted media attention.
- 3 years figuring out if it will work out or not. If its a bad idea luckily, it will fail. But that's not always the case, you try another 2 years and its a total waste of time and money. It will leave a black mark in your career. But if the startup does good for ten years, then its great.
- Being the CEO of a company:- You are not actually the boss, everyone else is- all your employees, customers, partners, users, media. You are accountable for many people. Life of a CEO is all about reporting to everyone else. There is no such thing as power here.
- Flexibility: You will get some flex time. You'll be able to work any 24 hours a day you want! You're always on call, you're a role model, you're always working anyway.
## Maximising impact
- Adding a late stage feature to an established company means you get a force multiplier from: 1) Massive user base 2) Existing infrastructure 3) Working with an established team. Example: Employee #1500 @google created the google maps.
## Best Reason
### Passion: You NEED to do it
- You'll need passion to endure the struggle
- You'll need passion to effectively recruit
### Aptitude: The world needs you to do it
- The world needs IT or do something that the world needs
- The world needs YOU: Its bad for the world if you just outcompete a team with more aptitude. The world needs you somewhere - find out where.

# 3) TEAM 
- Co-founders:- Don't hire someone whom you didn't share a long history with. Within a year or two, the team will tear apart. Best way to meet them is in college. Else working in a good company is a way to go. They have to be tough, need to act quick, decisive and they know what to do in every situation. In other words, relentlesly resourceful.
- Try not to hire though. People at start ask how many employees do you have and they use this as a metric. You should be proud of what you can do with a small team. Stay small as long as you can.
- The ones you hire should believe in what you believe. They need to be extremely dedicated. For example, first 40-50 employees should feel like they were a part of the founding of the company. Having extremely high bar and hiring slowly helps.
- Mediocre engineers do not build great companies. Don't screw it up in the early days.
- Personal referals are one of the keys to hiring.
- Experience doesn't matter in some areas in the early days and so aptitude and belief is the way to go.
- Are they smart? Do they get things done? Do I want to spend a lot of time around them?
- Work together on a project rather than doing an interview. But if you are doing an interview, you should ask them about the projects they have done in the past.
- Good communication skills, manically determined, pass the animal test (desribe each employee as an animal in the work they do, they need to be very good at getting things done) , have risk taking ability.
- 10% of company to the first 10 employees. For some reason founders are very stingy with equity to employees and very generous with equity to investors. But your employees are the ones who add more value. Fight against the equity that the investors get. They should get little as possible.
- You have hired - now keep them around. Make sure your employees are happy and feel valued.
- Let the team get credit for all the good things that happen and you take responsibility for the bad stuff that happens.
- Continually give people new areas of responsibility. Purpose, autonomy and mastery.
- One on ones and give clear feedback
- Fire fast:- People who create office politics and the ones who are persistently negative. Might be OK in a big company but will kill a startup.
- When should cofounders act on equity split? From the first few weeks itself.
- Inexperience is okay, but what if its not? The person should be able to learn fast. People who are smart will eventually find a role in a company as time goes on.
- What if your relationship with your cofounder falls apart? First thing in the early days itself, you need to have vesting on the equity. You pre-negotiate what happens when if one of you leaves. Don't have a dead weight on equity table. Its hard to get investors on board when that happens.
- Choosing between hiring a suboptimal employee and loosing a customer: Its better to lose a customer than to kill the company in the early days.
- Cofounders at different locations: Don't do it. Speed and communication outweigh everything else.
