# HOW TO START A STARTUP?
- There are four areas where we need to excel at: Idea, Product, Team and Execution.
## WHY?
- Never start just for the sake of doing so.
- You should feel compelled by a problem and should be ceratain that only creating a company can solve it. Passion first, startup second.
# 1) IDEA
- Start with one, not a pivot.
- Think about size and growth of the market, growth statergy for the company, defensibility statergy and so on.
- Wait to start a startup and wait until you come up with an idea you feel compelled to explore. Also a way to choose between multiple ideas. If you have several ideas that all seem pretty good, work on the one that you think about most often and don't think about work.
- The company to should feel like an important mission. Good startups usually take ten years.
- Its easier to start a hard startup than an easy one. This is a counter-intuivitive. Derivative companies that copy an existing idea with very few insights, don't compel their teams to work hard enough to be successful.
- Best ideas look terrible at the beginning. Startup is somewhere between "It is a good idea" and "It seems like a bad idea". If others say its a bad idea, be happy about that. That means no competition. "If a idea doesn't sound absurd at the beginning, there is no hope to it. 
- You can't get monopoly in a big market right away. Find a small market to get a monopoly and quickly expand.
- You want an idea about which you can say, "I know why it seems like a bad idea, but here is specifically why it is a great one". Sound crazy but also right.
- You need to research about the market. You need a market that is big in ten years. Investors make a mistake here, they care about the growth of the startup and not the market.
- Go after a company which is small but rapidly growing market than a big company in a small one.
- Most people think first of what they want to express or make, then find the audience for their idea. You do the exace opposite, thinking of the public first. You need to keep focus on their chaning trends, on their chaning needs. Beginning with their demand, you create the appropriate supply. 
## WHY NOW? 
- Why coudn't it have been done two years ago. Why is this the perfect time for this particular idea and to start this particular company. Why two years in the future will be two late?
- In general its best to build something that you need, you will understand it much better.
- If it takes more than a sentance to tell what your startup idea is about, then it is complicated.
## While you are a student:- 
- Think about new ideas.
- Meet potential co-founders.

# 2) PRODUCT
- Great idea -> Great product -> Great company
- Build something that users love.
- Talk to users.
- Build something that small no. of small users love than large no. of users like. It will be easier to expand.
- Great but simple products win.
- Get people manually, the goal is to get a small group of them to love you.
- Show it to users -> User feedback: What do they like? What do they pay for? What would make them recommend it? -> Product decision. This feedback loop should be as tight as possible. 
- Metrics (focus on growth):- Total registrations, active users, activity levels, cohort retention, revenue, net promotor score etc.
## Why start a startup?
- It is actually stressful. Responsibility: Your team bet the best years of their life on you, you are always on call, fundraising, unwanted media attention.
- 3 years figuring out if it will work out or not. If its a bad idea luckily, it will fail. But that's not always the case, you try another 2 years and its a total waste of time and money. It will leave a black mark in your career. But if the startup does good for ten years, then its great.
- Being the CEO of a company:- You are not actually the boss, everyone else is- all your employees, customers, partners, users, media. You are accountable for many people.
