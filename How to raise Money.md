## What do investors look for?
- Is this person a LEADER?
- Is this person rifle focused and obsessed by the product.
- What inspires you to make this product? Is it personal with you being the founder? Does the product solve your problem?
- Communication Skills.
- Venture Capital business is a game of outliers. It's extreme exceptions. 4000 fundable -> 200 funded by top tier VC -> 15 of those get to $100 million and return 97%.
- Invest in strength v/s lack of weaknesses. Check list.
- They invest in companies that have really extreme strength in a particular dimension. Some companies have big strengths but have serious flaws.
- Practice that one sentence that describes your product so that the investor you are talking to immediately get the picture in their mind.
- You have to be decisive. Don't procrastinate.
- Have clear vision and passion.
- Refer to checklist (photo uploaded).
- Bootstrap as long as you possibly can.
- Be so good they can't ignore you.
- Raising money is not that hard. It's not exactly a milestone. Well it's easier than hiring someone or getting ad revenues.
## What do entrepreneurs miss? It's Risk and Cash
- List all the risks down: founders' risk, product risk, technical risk, launch risk, market acceptance risk growth risks etc. It's like onion layers (onion theory of risk).
- Remove the layers of risks one by one.
- Peel aways risks by achieving milestones, then you are making progress and business. Then you are justifying raising money.
- Then you go to an investor and tell them you are raising your 'B' round. "I achieved these milestones, I eliminated these risks". Here is my B round, here are my milestones and risks.
## Don't ask people to sign an NDA (Non-disclosure agreement) 
- You ask at the very beginning, you are basically saying "I don't trust you".
- Get things in writing, get it is as quickly as possible.
- Raising money is just a small victory and a small step. Its fundamental. Get over it.
- Just resend the email to the investors because they tend to have short term memory.
- In meetings, take notes.
## THE PROCESS
- The investor company will do some background checks.
- The are going to have an internal meeting.
- If they call you for a meeting: they are most likely to invest.
## Venture Stage
- Top tier VCs typically invest in only two companies: Companies who have already raised a seed funding or with a founder who they know to be successful or have worked with in the past.
## Terms, what should founders care about most and how should they negotiate?
- There seemed to be, and they fluctuate over time, these thresholds particularly for seed stage companies that investors think that above this level is crazy, it doesnâ€™t matter. And there is a rough kind of range that people are willing to pay. You just have to figure out what that is. Just get the money that you need, don't raise any more than you need.
## MAX dilution?
- Well, 10-15% is the range beyond which it gets difficult at the table where there isn't enough room.
- Because if there is a forty percent dilution in an Angel round, I have actually said to the founder, do you realize you have already doomed yourself?
