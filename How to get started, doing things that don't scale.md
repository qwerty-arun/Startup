# Key takeaways from the lecture: 
## DoorDash
- They tried to solve the problem of delivery infrastructure for small business owners.
- They set up a landing page which had a phone number of their own but it is the hotels menu. If enough ppl called, then the idea is worth pursuing.
- Slowly but surely, day by day, they started getting orders. They never had a website, delivery equipment or any fancy stuff. They just launched.
- It was all about testing the idea.
- Three steps: Test your hypothesis, Launch Fast, Do things that don't scale (driving, customer support, real time feedback from customers).
- Everyone had a mobile back in the day, it was a new trend and they saw it coming! So everything they built was based on mobile.
## Teespring
- A platform for entrepreneurs to launch their products.
- There are three places to leverage your advantage: Finding your first users, turning those users into champions and finding product/market fit.
- Finding your first users: Do whatever it takes to bring in your first customers, phone everyday or e-mail. Don't focus on ROI, focus on growth. Don't give your product away for free. Make sure ppl value your procuct. At first, the curve is very steep, but once you cross that, things move on their own and its easier.
- Users->Champion : Delight your users with experiences they will remember, one way is to just talk to your users.
- Ways to talk to your customers: Run customer service as long as possible, proactively reach out to current and churned customers, social media or communities. Problems are inevitable, do whatever it takes to make them right.
- Find market fit: The product you launch with will not be the one product that gives you market fit. Optimize for speed over scalability/clean code. Only worry about the next order of magnitude. When you have 100 customers, you need to worry about 1000 and not a million.
- Necessity is the mother of all inventions: You'll find a way to make it work.
- Do things that don't scale as long as you possibly can.
